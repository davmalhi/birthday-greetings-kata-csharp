# What's this?

This is a simple refactoring exercise that is meant to teach something about dependency inversion and dependency injection.

The documentation is in  [this blog bost](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154) and in the presentation in the doc directory.  There is a Java version [here](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata)

## How to start

Run all the tests.  One test will fail.  Change production code so that all tests pass.

## How to continue

Read the [blog post](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154) and/or the  [presentation included in the Java version](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata).
